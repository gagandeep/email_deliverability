Introduction
===========

The Email Deliverability Library is a comprehensive toolkit designed to help developers implement best practices for email deliverability. It provides tools and guidance for email authentication (SPF, DKIM, DMARC), sender reputation monitoring, email list hygiene, and IP warming.

Why Email Deliverability Matters
-----------------------------------------

Email deliverability refers to the ability to get your emails into recipients' inboxes rather than spam folders or being rejected entirely. Good deliverability practices are crucial for effective email communication, whether you're sending marketing emails, transactional messages, or any other type of email communication.

Key challenges in email deliverability include:

1. **Authentication**: Proving you are who you say you are
2. **Reputation**: Demonstrating you're a trustworthy sender
3. **Content Quality**: Ensuring your emails don't trigger spam filters
4. **List Hygiene**: Maintaining high-quality recipient lists
5. **Technical Infrastructure**: Setting up your sending infrastructure properly
